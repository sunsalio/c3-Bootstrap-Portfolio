# c3-Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

The aim of this project was to build on a previous portfolio page that was created using CSS flex and grid. However, this updated porfolio utilised bootstrap components such as Navbar, Jumbotron, and card to showcase understanding of the newly acquired skills. Using Bootstrap helps save time writing HTML and CSS by providing free templates that build responsive websites.

## Usage

The navigation bar provides links to the different sections of the porfolio page starting with Homepage, a section about projects I've worked on, an about-me and skills sections and finally a section on how I can be contacted.
